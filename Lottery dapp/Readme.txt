This project is basically about a lottery project which has 2 components
1- Manager
2-Participating players

It also needs to be met with two conditions, no of participating players should be atleast 3 and every player has to pay exact 1 ether to participate in the lottery contest.

This Dapp basically accepts 1 ether from all the participating players and transfers it all to the randomly selected participant through the smart contract.


Through this project I learnt how to code the smart contract, create the frontend of the project and integrate it with smart contract using web3.js. The project was successfully deployed and tested on ganache blockchain using truffle suite
